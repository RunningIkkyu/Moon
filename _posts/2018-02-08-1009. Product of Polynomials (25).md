# 1009. Product of Polynomials (25)
This time, you are supposed to find A*B where A and B are two polynomials.

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, and each line contains the information of a polynomial:
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;K&space;\&space;N_{1}\&space;a_{N_{1}}&space;\&space;N_{2}&space;\&space;a_{N_{2}}\&space;...\&space;N_{K}&space;\&space;a_{N_{K}}" title="K \ N_{1}\ a_{N_{1}} \ N_{2} \ a_{N_{2}}\ ...\ N_{K} \ a_{N_{K}}" />
 where K is the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial, Ni and aNi (i=1, 2, ..., K) are the exponents and coefficients, respectively. It is given that 1 <= K <= 10, 0 <= NK < ... < N2 < N1 <=1000.

## Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the product of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input. Notice that there must be NO extra space at the end of each line. Please be accurate up to 1 decimal place.

## Sample Input
```
2 1 2.4 0 3.2
2 2 1.5 1 0.5
```
## Sample Output
```
3 3 3.6 2 6.0 1 1.6
```

# Analysis
Use two double array in this problem, one is to save the first polynomial, the other one is to save the result when we input the second polynomial. Note that the array should big enough, cause the maximum of exponent after the production of polynomial may rise up to 2000 (1000 + 1000). 

# Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath>        // stuck here once.
#include <algorithm>
#define N 3015          // stuct here once.
using namespace std;

int main(void)
{
    double coefficients_1[N], coefficients_2[N], co;
    int ex, k1, k2, cnt = 0;

    // init 
    fill(coefficients_1, coefficients_1+N, 0);
    fill(coefficients_2, coefficients_2+N, 0);

    // input handling
    cin>>k1;
    for(int i = 0; i < k1; i++){
        cin>>ex>>co;
        coefficients_1[ex] = co;
    }
    cin>>k2;
    for(int j = 0; j < k2; j++) {
        cin>>ex>>co;
        
        // stuck here once. index i < N
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            // coefficients_2 save the result.
            if(coefficients_1[i] > 1e-6)
                coefficients_2[ex+i] += co * coefficients_1[i];
    }

    // count the number of non-zero terms.
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) if(abs(coefficients_2[i]) > 1e-6) cnt++;

    // output
    cout<<cnt;
    for(int i = N-1; i >= 0 ; i--){
        if(abs(coefficients_2[i]) > 1e-6){
            cout<<" "<<i;
            cout<<setiosflags(ios::fixed)<<setprecision(1)<<" "<<coefficients_2[i];
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

# Note
> 1. Coefficients array should large enought ( 2001 at least).
> 2. Do not forget include essential library, I used abs() fucntion in my code but forgot to include <cmath>. There's no error while I compiled the code by g++, but cannot pass the first test point on the Onlie Judgement System. 
> 3. If you can't find obvious logical error in your error, check every index in your loop.
