# 1003. Emergency (25)

As an emergency rescue team leader of a city, you are given a special map of your country. The map shows several scattered cities connected by some roads. Amount of rescue teams in each city and the length of each road between any pair of cities are marked on the map. When there is an emergency call to you from some other city, your job is to lead your men to the place as quickly as possible, and at the mean time, call up as many hands on the way as possible.    
  
## Input

Each input file contains one test case. For each test case, the first line contains 4 positive integers: N (<= 500) - the number of cities (and the cities are numbered from 0 to N-1), M - the number of roads, C1 and C2 - the cities that you are currently in and that you must save, respectively. The next line contains N integers, where the i-th integer is the number of rescue teams in the i-th city. Then M lines follow, each describes a road with three integers c1, c2 and L, which are the pair of cities connected by a road and the length of that road, respectively. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one path from C1 to C2.  
  
## Output

For each test case, print in one line two numbers: the number of different shortest paths between C1 and C2, and the maximum amount of rescue teams you can possibly gather.  
All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there is no extra space allowed at the end of a line.  

## Sample Input
```
5 6 0 2
1 2 1 5 3
0 1 1
0 2 2
0 3 1
1 2 1
2 4 1
3 4 1
```
## Sample Output
```
2 4
```

## Analysis
The problem can be solved by many differents algorithms. We can use [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://runningikkyu.github.io/Greedy-Algorithm-Dikjstra's-Algorithm/) to solve it. 
Fisrt, we need an adjacent matrix to save the road. And we can know from the description that there should be a variable to remember the path with same distance and a variable to save the team we have gathered. The code is quite simple, just make little changes to the [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://runningikkyu.github.io/Greedy-Algorithm-Dikjstra's-Algorithm/). Here is my solution:
```c

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#define N 505
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
using namespace std;


// Utility funtion to find the vertex with minimum distance value from
// the set of vertices not yet included in the shortest path.
int minDis(int dis[], bool sptSet[], int n){
    int min = INF, min_ind;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        if(sptSet[i] == false && dis[i] < min)
        {
            min = dis[i]; 
            min_ind = i;
        }
    return min_ind;
}

int main(void)
{
    int n, m, c1, c2;   // number of citys, number of roads, start city, end city.
    int t1, t2, t3;     // tmp variable.
    int team_number[N]; // number of teams of each city.
    int roads[N][N];    // adjacent matrix of city, each element in the matrix is distance between cities. 
    int num[N];         // num[i] indacates the number of paths from c1 to i.
    int dis[N];         // dis[i] will hold the shortest distance from c1 to i.
    int gathered[N];    // gathered meant teams we have gathered from start nodes to i.
    bool sptSet[N];     // shortest path set, sptSet[i] is true indacates i is in sptSet.

    // Init arrays.
    fill(team_number, team_number+N, 0);
    fill(roads[0], roads[0]+N*N, INF);
    fill(dis, dis+N, INF);
    fill(sptSet, sptSet+N, 0);

    // Input handling.
    cin>>n>>m>>c1>>c2;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
        cin>>team_number[i];
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) 
    {
        cin>>t1>>t2>>t3;
        roads[t2][t1] = roads[t1][t2] = t3;
    }

    // Initialization after input
    dis[c1] = 0;        // make sure the source vertex is picked first.
    num[c1] = 1;        // initial num[c1] with 1.
    gathered[c1] = team_number[c1];

    // Dijkstra's algorithm
    // iterate n-1 times to make sure every nodes has been added into sptSet.
    for(int count = 0; count < n-1; count++){
        // pick a vertex u with minimum distance which is not in sptSet.
        int u = minDis(dis, sptSet, n);
        // add u to sptSet
        sptSet[u] = true;
        for(int v=0; v<n; v++){
            // iterate every adjacent nodes of u which is not in sptSet.
            if(sptSet[v] == false && roads[u][v] != INF){
                // if dis[v] can be shrink by node u. 
                if(dis[u] + roads[u][v] < dis[v]){
                    // update the value of dis[v] with the smaller value.
                    dis[v] = dis[u] + roads[u][v];
                    // update the number of paths of v.
                    num[v] = num[u];
                    // update the team we can gathered.
                    gathered[v] = team_number[v] + gathered[u];
                }
                // else if these two way have the same distance, a
                else if(dis[u] + roads[u][v] == dis[v]){
                    num[v] = num[u] + num[v];
                    if(gathered[v] < gathered[u] + team_number[v])
                        gathered[v] = gathered[u] + team_number[v];
                }//elif

    cout<<num[c2]<<" "<<gathered[c2]<<endl;
    return 0;

You can also download this code from my github([RunningIkkyu](https://github.com/RunningIkkyu/PAT/blob/master/1003.Emergency/1003.Emergency.cpp)).  
All key things has been writen in notes, this code can be optimized further even this code can pass the OJ.
