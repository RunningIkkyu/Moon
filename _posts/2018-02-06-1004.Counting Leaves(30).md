# 1004. Counting Leaves (30)
A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree. Your job is to count those family members who have no child.
## Input

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0 < N < 100, the number of nodes in a tree, and M (< N), the number of non-leaf nodes. Then M lines follow, each in the format:  
```
ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
```
where ID is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, K is the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit ID's of its children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be 01.  
## Output

For each test case, you are supposed to count those family members who have no child for every seniority level starting from the root. The numbers must be printed in a line, separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of each line.  
  
The sample case represents a tree with only 2 nodes, where 01 is the root and 02 is its only child. Hence on the root 01 level, there is 0 leaf node; and on the next level, there is 1 leaf node. Then we should output "0 1" in a line.  
  
##  Sample Input
```
2 1
01 1 02
```
## Sample Output
```
0 1
```

## Analysis
This is a simple tree tranversal problem, still, it can be solved by many ways, like bfs, dfs and level order tree tranversal. In this post, we use a recursion function to solved the problem.  

From the form of input above, it's obviously that every non-leaf node has been given, so that we can get every leaf node. May be you've also noticed the information we need to solve this problem are the number of leaf node in each level. We don't care all the children of some node, so every node just need a point to their parents. Let's see an example:

We set an array called tree, tree[i] indicates node-i's parents, just like pointer.The array's content:

For each node, we don't know their depth(level), but we do know their depth is equal to their parent's depth add one. until the root, we know the level of the root is fisrt, so we can know the current leaf-node's depth by recursion.  

## Pseudocode
```
// level_counter[i] is the number of leaf node in i-th level
// tree[i] is node_i's partent.
function cal_node_depth(node_id, cur_depth):
    visited[node_id] = true;
    if node is root:
        level_counter[cur_depth]++;
        exit function;
    cal_node_depth(tree[node_id], cur_depth+1);

for each leaf node i:
    if i havn't been visited:
        cal_node_depth(i, 0);
```

# Solution
You can also download this code from my github(RunningIkkyu).  
All key things has been writen in notes, this code can be optimized further even this code can pass the OJ.  
  
```c
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int tree[105];          // tree[i] saves node-i's parents.
int visited[105];       // nonleaf node marked 1, leafnode markded zero.
int level_cnt[100];     // level_cnt[i] indicates the number of leaf node in i level.
int max_level = -1;     // save the max level of this tree.

// calculate the level where the leaf-node id located.
void cal_level(int id, int depth)
{
    // almost forget this statement.
    visited[id] = 1;
    // exit of recusion, when current node is root, end this calculation up.
    if(id == 1){
        level_cnt[depth]++;
        // update max_level
        max_level = max(max_level, depth);
        return;
    }
    // calculate the depth of [id]'s parents by recursion.
    cal_level(tree[id], depth+1);
}

// what we supposed to do is finding the level of leaf node, and see how many
// of these node in every level. From given input, We can figure out which part
// is non-leaf node, and the other nodes in the input is leaf nodes. So what we
// gonna to do is count these nodes' level and save number of leaf node in each
// level.
int main(void)
{
    int n, m, id_tmp, k, tmp;

    // initial array.
    fill(tree, tree+105, -1);
    fill(visited, visited+105, -1);
    fill(level_cnt, level_cnt+100, 0);

    // Input handling
    cin>>n>>m;

    // In case that there's only root node.
    // The code cannot passes third test point without this statement.
    if (m==0) visited[1] = 0;

    // Input handling
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++){
        cin>>id_tmp>>k;
        // marked non-leaf node.
        visited[id_tmp] = 1;
        while(k--){
            cin>>tmp;
            // if node-tmp do not have children, then marked as leaf node.
            if(visited[tmp] != 1) visited[tmp] = 0;
            // tree[tmp] point to their parents.
            tree[tmp] = id_tmp;
        }
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++){
        // for each leaf node, calculate its depth and add to level_cnt.
        if(visited[i] == 0)
            cal_level(i, 0);
    }

    // in case that there's only root node in the tree.
    if (max_level == -1) max_level = 0;

    // print level_cnt from first level  to maximum level.
    for(int i = 0; i <= max_level; i++){
        if(i != 0) cout<<" ";
        cout<<level_cnt[i];
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Note
> 1. Don't forget the case that there's only root node in the tree.
> 2. Make sure every array you used in your code is big enough.
