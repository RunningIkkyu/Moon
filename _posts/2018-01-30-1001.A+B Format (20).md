# 1001. A+B Format (20)

Calculate a + b and output the sum in standard format -- that is, the digits must be separated into groups of three by commas (unless there are less than four digits).

## Input

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a pair of integers a and b where -1000000 <= a, b <= 1000000. The numbers are separated by a space.

## Output

For each test case, you should output the sum of a and b in one line. The sum must be written in the standard format.
## Sample Input

>-1000000 9

## Sample Output

>-999,991

## Note
>* Output the first n digits at first ( n is the remainer of length of sum by 3).
>* Don't forget the sign of number.
>* Solution is not unique.

## Solution
``` c
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

void format_output(long a){
    bool isnegative = (a<0?1:0);
    if (isnegative){
        cout<<"-";
        a = -a;
    }
    // string to reserve the result.
    string res;

    // convert a to string.
    stringstream ss;
    ss<<a;
    string s = ss.str();

    int j = 0;
    // remainder of length by 3
    int rem = s.length() % 3;
    // output head digits, which mounts is rem.
    for(int i = 0; i < rem; i++) cout<<s[i];
    // output remain digits and comma.
    for(int i = rem; i < s.length(); i++){
        if((i-rem)%3 == 0 && (i-rem) != 0) cout<<",";
        if((i-rem) == 0 && rem) cout<<",";
        cout<<s[i];
    }
    cout<<endl;
}

int main(void)
{
    long a, b, c;
    cin>>a>>b;
    format_output(a+b);
    return 0;
}
```
