# 1007. Maximum Subsequence Sum (25)
Given a sequence of K integers {![N1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_{1}), ![N2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_{2}), ...,![NK](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_{K} ) }. A continuous subsequence is defined to be { ![Ni](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_{i}), ![N_{i+1}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_{i+1}), ..., ![N_{j}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_{j}) } where 1 <= i <= j <= K. The Maximum Subsequence is the continuous subsequence which has the largest sum of its elements. For example, given sequence { -2, 11, -4, 13, -5, -2 }, its maximum subsequence is { 11, -4, 13 } with the largest sum being 20.  
  
Now you are supposed to find the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence.  
  
## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies two lines. The first line contains a positive integer K (<= 10000). The second line contains K numbers, separated by a space.  

## Output Specification:

For each test case, output in one line the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence. The numbers must be separated by one space, but there must be no extra space at the end of a line. In case that the maximum subsequence is not unique, output the one with the smallest indices i and j (as shown by the sample case). If all the K numbers are negative, then its maximum sum is defined to be 0, and you are supposed to output the first and the last numbers of the whole sequence.

## Sample Input:
```
10
-10 1 2 3 4 -5 -23 3 7 -21
```
## Sample Output:
```
10 1 4
```

# Analysis
Iterate from the first element, save the start index and current sum. If current sum below zero, which means this part didn't included in the longest sequence, then drop it. And update the start index of current sequence to the next element.

# Pseudocode
```
integer max_seq_sum = -1
integer max_seq_start_index
integer max_seq_end_index
integer start = 0
integer num = 0
for each element ele in num[]:
    sum = sum + ele
    if sum > max_seq_sum:
        max_seq_sum = sum
        max_seq_start_index = start
        max_seq_end_index = index of ele
    if sum < 0:
        start = index of ele + 1
        sum = 0
```

# Note
> 1. You're supposed to output the start number and end number, not the start and end index.
> 2. Don't forget the case that all the numbers are negative.

# Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define N 10010

using namespace std;

int main(void)
{
    // variable defination.
    int k; 
    int num[N];
    // max_i and max_j are the start and end index of the maximum sequence.
    int max_i = 0, max_j = 0;
    int max_sum = -1;   // save the sum of maxium sequence.
    int sum = 0;        // the sum of current sequence.
    int start = 0;      // the start index of current sequence.
    
    // input handling.
    cin>>k;
    for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) cin>>num[i];

    // for each element, add it into sum.
    for(int i = 0; i < k; i++){
        sum += num[i];
        // if the sum of current sequence is bigger than max_sum.
        // save the max value, start index and end index.
        if(sum > max_sum) {
            max_sum = sum;
            max_i = start;
            max_j = i;
        }
        // if current sum below zero, then drop it. 
        // and update start index and clear the value of sum.
        if(sum < 0) {
            start = i + 1;
            sum = 0;
        }
    }

    // if maxiumum sum below zero, that means all the numbers are negative.
    if(max_sum < 0){
        max_i = 0;
        max_j = k-1;
        max_sum = 0;
    }

    // output the result.
    cout<<max_sum<<" "<<num[max_i]<<" "<<num[max_j]<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
