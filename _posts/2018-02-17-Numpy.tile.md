# numpy.tile

## numpy.tile(A, reps)
Construct an array by repeating A the number of times given by reps.  
  
If reps has length d, the result will have dimension of *max(d, A.ndim)*.  

If *A.ndim* < d, A is promoted to be d-dimensional by prepending new axes. So a shape (3,) array is promoted to (1, 3) for 2-D replication, or shape (1, 1, 3) for 3-D replication. If this is not the desired behavior, promote A to d-dimensions manually before calling this function.   
  
If *A.ndim* > d, reps is promoted to A.ndim by pre-pending 1’s to it. Thus for an A of shape (2, 3, 4, 5), a reps of (2, 2) is treated as (1, 1, 2, 2).  
  
> Note : Although tile may be used for broadcasting, it is strongly recommended to use numpy’s broadcasting operations and functions.


### Parameters:	
> **A** : array_like  
    * The input array.

> **reps** : array_like  
    * The number of repetitions of A along each axis.

### Returns:	
>  **c** : ndarray  
    * The tiled output array.
    
   
   
## Examples

```python
>>> a = np.array([0, 1, 2])
>>> np.tile(a, 2)
array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])
>>> np.tile(a, (2, 2))
array([[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2],
       [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]])
>>> np.tile(a, (2, 1, 2))
array([[[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]],
       [[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]]])
```
  
  
```python
>>> b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
>>> np.tile(b, 2)
array([[1, 2, 1, 2],
       [3, 4, 3, 4]])
>>> np.tile(b, (2, 1))
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4],
       [1, 2],
       [3, 4]])
```

```python
>>> c = np.array([1,2,3,4])
>>> np.tile(c,(4,1))
array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
       [1, 2, 3, 4],
       [1, 2, 3, 4],
       [1, 2, 3, 4]])
```
