Even among the machine learning practitioners there isn't a well accepted definition of what it is and what it isn't machine learning. But many people have tried to defined them.

# Machine Learning definition
* Arthur Samuel(1959) : Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* Tom Mitchell (1998) : A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.  

A checkers learning problem: 
* Task T: playing checkers
* Performance measure P: percent of games won against opponents 
* Training experience E: playing practice games against itself
  
We can specify many learning problems in this fashion, such as learningto recognize handwritten words, or learning to drive a robotic automobile autonomously.


# Machine learning algorithms:
* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
Others : Reinforcement learning, recommender systems.
