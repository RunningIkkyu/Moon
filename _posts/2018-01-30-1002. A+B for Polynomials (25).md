# 1002. A+B for Polynomials (25)

This time, you are supposed to find A+B where A and B are two polynomials.

## Input

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, and each line contains the information of a polynomial: K N1 aN1 N2 aN2 ... NK aNK, where K is the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial, Ni and aNi (i=1, 2, ..., K) are the exponents and coefficients, respectively. It is given that 1 <= K <= 10ï¼Œ0 <= NK < ... < N2 < N1 <=1000.

## Output

For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input. Notice that there must be NO extra space at the end of each line. Please be accurate to 1 decimal place.
## Sample Input
```
2 1 2.4 0 3.2
2 2 1.5 1 0.5
```
## Sample Output
```
3 2 1.5 1 2.9 0 3.2
```
## Note
> * Make sure coefficients is large enough, like 1005, 1010 or even 2000, 10000...  just don't use 1000.
> * Init coefficients array by zero.
> * Output must ordered by their exponent from larger to small and accurate to 1 decimal places.
> * No extra space.

## Solution
``` c
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

// 1005 is to make sure the coefficients array is big enough
float coefficients[1005];

int main(void)
{
    int k, ex;
    float co; 

    // init coefficients array by zero.
    memset(coefficients, 0, sizeof(coefficients));  // init coefficients with zero.

    // handle input.
        cin>>k;
        while(k--){
            cin>>ex>>co;
            coefficients[ex] += co;
        }
        cin>>k;
        while(k--){
            cin>>ex>>co;
            coefficients[ex] += co;
        }
    // record mounts of nonzero terms.
    int count = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 1002; i++) if(coefficients[i]) count += 1;
    cout<<count;

    // output each nonzero terms from large to small.
    for(int i = 1004; i >= 0; i--){
        if(coefficients[i]) cout<<" "<<i<<" "<<setiosflags(ios::fixed)<<setprecision(1)<<coefficients[i];
    }
    cout<<endl;
    return 0;
}
